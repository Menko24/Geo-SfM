## Digital bananas

```{sidebar} Banana for Scale

Based on the material covered in [session 2](../georeferencing/overview "overviewl2"):
- How would you proceed to get a digital model with dimensions equivalent to the real object?
- What should be the lowest number of *photo haloes* around an object?
- Once all has been decided, is there any possibility of throwing in automated processing?
```

Agisoft has been so kind to publish a tutorial on the digitisation of hand-sized samples, which we will follow and adapt for to-scale digitisation.

Have a look at the following [Metashape tutorial](https://agisoft.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/31000155265-how-to-build-a-complete-360-degree-model-of-an-object), and proceed by digitising either the *banana* or the *water jug*.
All required material is linked to from within the tutorial.

As an added exercise, make sure to create the [standardised project directory](#tutorial:standardised-environment) and fill out the [hand-sized sample metadata template](../suppl/metadata_lists) found under resources.
