# Exercise - learning the ropes of GCP and marker detection

```{admonition} Deadline
Please complete this exercise **by the start of the next session**.
```

## Learning goals

**After this session you will be able to:**

- Generate your own set of GCPs;
- Manually detect GCPs in a set of images; and,
- Automatically detect GCPs using computer algorithms.

Please note that **we only provide feedback and support for students enrolled in the course at the University Centre of Svalbard**.

We now focus on familiarising ourselves with the concept of GCPs and markers.
This includes the generation of both Metashape markers and open-source ArUco markers, as well as their manual and automated detection.

## Assignment

Proceed to the [GCP tutorial](../georeferencing/markers "GCP tutorial") while keeping the following assignments in mind:

`````{admonition} Checklist and questions
:class: note

The workflow:
- [ ] Create a {ref}`hand-drawn marker grid <student_marker>` on A4 with 4 corners marked (i.e., the GCPs).
- [ ] Measure the distances between the GCPs, treating the top left corner as your origin GCP (=0,0).
- [ ] Place a small object in the middle, not covering any of the grid points.
- [ ] Image the object as per last session.
- [ ] Create a new Metashape project conforming the standardised project environment
- [ ] Import photos, manually detect the GCPs, and assign real world coordinates to the GCPs
- [ ] Run all steps leading up to and including texture generation (and export processing report).

In addition, please come up with some thoughts on the following statements:

- GCP detection requires only part of the markers to be visible in an image
- A GCP should always be fully imaged in at least five images
- The original, real-world object and the digital model are identical in dimensions (pro tip: [measure this using the ruler tool](#geomodelling:tutorial:ruler)).

```{figure} assets/student_marker.png
:name: student_marker

One does not need to use the binary markers per se.
As long as you have access to a ruler, pencil, and flat (and big enough) piece of paper, you can create your own marker grid.
Then simply put the object in the middle, and voila!

```

Stuck in home-office without a printer but still have access to paper, a ruler and pencil?
You're out of luck when it comes to automated GCP recognition.
However, you could always measure out 4 points and draw them on the paper in a rectangle.
Make sure to set one corner as the origin (0,0), and use your ruler to measure the other marker-point coordinates correspondingly.
