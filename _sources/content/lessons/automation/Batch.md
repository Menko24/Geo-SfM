# Batch-based processing through Metashape GUI

Batch processing can be initiated through the Metashape GUI by selecting *Workflow/Batch Process..*.
The resulting {ref}`batch_gui` allows for most Metashape processing steps to be sequentially automated, i.e., one after another.

:name: batch_gui

The Metashape GUI batch processing dialog.
Make sure to always select *Save project after each step* to save yourself from computer crashes and power outages - or Windows updates (ouch!).
```

The dialog allows the setting of all processing parameters as per their individual operations.
This includes only selecting certain chunks or photo elements for processing.
Make sure to refer to [the Metashape tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial "tutorial") for step-specific recommendations.
