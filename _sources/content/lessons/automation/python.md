# Python-based standardised processing

The following page provices an overview of the functions that are implemented in [Automated Metashape](https://github.com/PeterBetlem/image_processing).
These require the Python to be installed as documented in [the software section](#about:software:python).

```{admonition} Version
The tutorial below assumes the latest version of Automated Metashape is used.
Minimal differences may exist between versions, especially when ensuring compatibility with Minor updates of the Agisoft Metashape releases.
```

Please cite the following acknowledgement when using the automated metashape scripting package:

## Automated processing with Jupyter lab

We here showcase the Automated Metashape scripts through use of Jupyter lab.
When ready, open Anaconda Prompt again, change into the *automated_metashape* environment, and run *Jupyter lab*.

```{code} shell
conda activate automated_metashape
jupyter lab
```

This should open up your webbrowser, and opens up the Jupyter lab interface that is used for processing.

```{warning}
Do not close the Anaconda Prompt that is running in the background.
This would instantly stop Python, and prevent processing of the models.
```

The interface features a filesystem viewer on the left, a menu bar in the top, and the main interface (with tabs) makes up the remainder of the screen.

First, make sure to browse to the file directory where you would like to store your documents.
When ready, create a *Python 3 Notebook* from the *Launcher tab*.
Save it in the following manner, creating directories where needed:

```
project_directory (The folder with all files related to this project)
├───────Notebook_directory (where you unzipped the files to)
|           Automated_metashape_notebook.ipynb (the Python 3 Notebook you just created)
└───────config (remains empty for now)
```

Here we can copy/paste the below (into individual cells);
then proceed by running each cell by either clicking the *play* button or shift-enter whilst having click on the cell.


```{code} ipython3
from automated_metashape.MetashapeProcessing import AutomatedProcessing as AP
```

```{code} ipython3
config_file = "../config/empty_photogrammetry_processing_settings.yml"
project = AP()
project.read_config(config_file)
project.init_workspace()
project.init_tasks()
```

```{code} ipython3

     50 

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '..\\config\\empty_photogrammetry_processing_settings.yml'
```

If all went well, the AutomatedProcessing module was successfully imported (= no error on first input).
However, as per above, we have a *FileNotFoundError* - after all, we have yet to set up the configuration file that was linked to.

(section:python:minimalconf)=
### Minimal YAML configuration file

The automated processing scripts rely on a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) configuration file.
YAML (or *YAML Ain't Markup Language*) is a human friendly data serialization standard for programming languages.

Proceed by creating a new file in the *config* directory created previously and give it the *.yml* extension.
Name this file according to the project you are working on.

At the very least, copy-paste in the project-level parameters found below.
These should be present in every YAML configuration file, regardless of the desired outcome.

```yaml
run_name: # name of the project run (e.g., KonusdalenWestFault)
load_project_path: # This field may remain empty; put the absolute filepath to a pre-existing Agisoft Metashape project here if it is to be loaded.
project_path: # path to Agisoft Metashape project directory, usually {photo_path}/metashape
project_crs: "EPSG::32633" # 32633 is WGS1984 UTM 33N; epsg number that corresponds to the required project crs. Look here: https://epsg.io/ "EPSG::40400" for hand samples.
subdivide_task: True # Fine-level task subdivision reduces memory by breaking processing into independent chunks that are run in series. True recommended.
enable_overwrite: False # If set to True, overwrites project that is loaded with load_project_path parameter. Use with caution!
```

The above won't do much - it simply creates a new Metashape project or loads an existing project and saves it again.

```{admonition} Use the standardised folder structure
:class: tip

As the script automatically searches for all compatible images within the photo_path, make sure to use the standardised folder structure described in the [Metashape tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial "tutorial").
```

```{admonition} Correctly filling out YAML configuration
:class: warning

Make sure...
- keep at least one space between the : (colon) and parameter
    - bad: load_project_path:asdasfasd #comment here
- keep at least one space between the parameter and # (comment)
    - bad: load_project_path: asdasfasd#comment here
- not to use any new lines in the configuration files
    - bad: load_project_path: asda ...
    - ... sfasd#comment here
```

(section:python:additionalparam)=
#### Additional parameters

Steps can be run or skipped using the 'enabled' parameter. If enabled == False, everything else in the step is irrelevant.
Alternatively, the entire parameter can be left out.
Keep in mind, though, that some steps require others to be completed.
E.g., not adding photos is likely to prevent photo alignment in some cases. ;)

The metashape functions powering each of these steps are listed in the comments in parentheses.
Refer to [Metashape documentation](https://www.agisoft.com/pdf/metashape_python_api_1_6_0.pdf) for full parameter definitions.
The parameter-section names should fully follow the parameter names of the Metashape functions.
In case default parameters are to be used, remove the corresponding parameter-section.

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} Add photos
```yaml
addPhotos:
    enabled: True
    photo_path: # path to photo directory ("data_directory" in the standardised folder directory)  - this parameter will be moved to the addPhotos configuration section in later releases.
    remove_photo_location_metadata: False # Removes photo location metadata
    multispectral: False # Is this a multispectral photo set? If RGB, set to False.
```

```{admonition} remove_photo_location_metadata
The *remove_photo_location_metadata* parameter removes all location data from the photos that are added to the project.
This should generally only be set to *True* when ground control points (GCPs) are to be used.
```
````

````{tab-item} Analyze images
```yaml
analyzeImages:
    enabled: True
    quality_cutoff: 0.5 # value between 0 and 1, indicates the lowest quality unit at which photos are used for processing. 0.5 is suggested by Agisoft.

**Note the different internal values for the settings compared to the Aligment parameter with identical name!**

### Another shot

After copying over the desired parameter-sections, update the config_file path correspondingly and run the cell again.
It should now result in a successful runtime.

```{code} python
config_file = "../config/photogrammetry_processing_settings.yml"
project = AP()
project.read_config(config_file)
project.init_workspace()
project.init_tasks()

```{admonition} Did you know...
:class: tip
... that you can continue processing an existing project by linking to the project file through the *load_project_path* parameter?
This allows you to inspect the processing after each step, figure out which parameters to adjust, and revise the YAML configuration accordingly.
Further processing then copies and leaves your original project unaltered.
```

```{admonition} Did you know...
:class: tip
... that the output shown while processing is also stored in a log file in the *output_path*?
It even has all the implemted YAML parameter-sections, software versions, and computer specs.
It can be easily used to reprocess and exactly repeat the processing.
```
