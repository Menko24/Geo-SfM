# Exercise - Digitising field samples

```{admonition} Deadline
The following exercise is to be completed **prior to the final semester presentation**.

:class: seealso
A summary of the methodology as well as numerous tips and tricks can be found in the [Small object SfM photogrammetry](hss_tutorial) and [Foldio360 Tutorial](hss_tutorial) pages, which should be explored as part of the open-ended exercise below.
```

## Exercise

- Whilst out on a fieldtrip, collect at least one (1) sample in which any given dimension falls between 5 and 15 centimetres;
- Write down coordinates of the exact sampling location, fill out the [sample metadata form](../suppl/metadata_lists) in full  (i.e., those fields related to the sampling, not yet processing);
- When back, process the collected sample and create a to-scale 3D digital hand-sized sample model without artefacts using the [automated photography light box procedure](hss_tutorial).
- Finalise the [sample metadata form](../suppl/metadata_lists) and submit/discuss it with the course responsible. This include the SketchFab ID which is only obtained after the submission has been quality controlled and the model has been uploaded to SketchFab.

````{admonition} Bulk sample density
:class: note

Seeing as your digital model is 1:1 scaled with the real sample, any idea on how to calculate its bulk density?

```{admonition} Metashape volume measurement
:class: tip

Metashape provides a built-in feature to determine a model's volume (*Tools/Mesh/Measure Area and Volume...*).
Be careful, though, as this calculates the total volume of *all* closed surfaces/meshes in your project.
The calculated volume is furthermore given in m3 - so make sure to apply the correct conversion.
Better yet, use some handy Python code that calculates the volumes in cm3 instead.

````{admonition} Model annotation and interpretation
:class: tip

The same tools used for interpreting and annotating digital outcrop models (DOMs) can also be used for hand-sized digital models.
Have a look at the [geomodelling tutorial](../geomodelling/geomodel_tutorial) to get started.
