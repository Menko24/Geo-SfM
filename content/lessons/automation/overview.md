# Automation

While processing can easily be done manually, real gains are made when things are automated.
Automation can be done through various means and to different extents, with the most notable being through use of the [Metashape GUI](#section:batch) and through the [automated Python scripts](#section:python).

There is more to automation than just efficiency.
Automation often requires a set of commands and parameters to be set prior to processing.
This is done to allow processing of subsequent steps to proceed even whilst the operator steps away from the keyboard.
Given a list of these parameters, the resulting output should always be the same as long as identical software versions and input data is used.
In other words: an easy +1 for scientific reproducibility, no?
