# Interpreting in Metashape

```{admonition} Work in progress
:class: tip

Interpretation of the digital model can be done through different means.
Thusfar, the tutorial only specific actions done through the Metashape GUI.
Feel free to contribute with a different programme workflow.
```

### Metashape

#### Annotations: points, polylines, polygons

Point clouds, meshes and tiled models can all be interpreted directly from within the Metashape GUI.
{numref}`metashape_point_selection` shows the annotation drop-down menu, in which both the annotation type (e.g., *points*) and mechanism can be selected (e.g., *snap to grid*).

```{figure} assets/metashape_point_selection.png
:name: metashape_point_selection

Various annotation options can be selected, including polylines, polygons and points (combined referred to as *shapes*).
```

Once the annotation type and mechanism are set, the model can be annotated by clicking in the desired locations.
For points, a left-mouse single click results in the creation of a point.
{ref}`Polylines <interp_clicking>` and polygons require clicking along the feature until the end is reached, which corresponds to a double-click with the left-mouse button.
In all cases, termination of the annotation exercise results in a {ref}`property window <interp_clicking>`.
Here the label of the shape can be changed, the description set, and new shape groups and properties created or revised.

```{figure} assets/interp_clicking.gif
:name: interp_clicking

Polyline annotation of a fracture in a digital outcrop model.
Similar operations allow one to annotate the model with points and polygons.
```

Subsequently - as long as the polyline or polygon is selected - one can add additional vertices to the annotation by clicking *i* on the keyboard, or *r* to remove them.
The same can also be achieved through the {ref}`right-click pop-up window <interp_clicking>`, which furthermore gives access to the same *property window* by selecting *Properties*.

```{figure} assets/interp_properties.gif
:name: interp_properties

Polyline interaction options.
Use right-click on a selected shape to open the pop-up menu.
Similar operations allow one to interact with points and polygons.
```

#### Ruler tool

While distances could easily be calculated from the different points in a shape, the {ref}`ruler tool <interp_ruler>` provides an easier way of doing so.
Simply activate the tool and left-click the points of interest to return a distance.

```{figure} assets/interp_ruler.gif
:name: interp_ruler

Measuring distances within a digital model.
Don't believe the given value is right?
Or would you like to verify that your model is indeed to scale?
Measure the real-world dimensions (e.g., height of a hand-sized sample) and their digital counterparts and compare.
```

```{admonition} Strange distance values or coordinates?
:class: warning

It could be that your model has not been properly constrained with a coordinate system or CRS (e.g., from photos with GPS metadata, GCPs).
Having a valid CRS set for your Metashape project not only allows your model to be exported with real-world coordinates, it also gives meaning to the values given onscreen.
Remember the SketchFab Labs distance feature discussed in [Session 4](#small-objects:overview)?
If you look closely you will notice that only numbers are given without units.
SketchFab is an example of a service that does not use a CRS.
One therefore has to guess what the original CRS of the uploaded model is to make sense of the SketchFab Labs distances.
```

When the model has been annotated, one can simply export the (georeferenced) annotations by selecting *File/Export/Export Shapes...*.
First a dialog will prompt a save location and savefile type.
The *shapefile format*, though old and a pain to work with, is a well-known standard and can be opened in most GIS-capable software solutions (including Petrel).
Once specified, {ref}`the shapes export dialog <interp_export>` allows for a selection of which shapes to export; whether to only export their points, polylines, and/or polygons, and which CRS the exported file should use.
Make sure to always enable the *Shape labels* and *Shape attributes* for exporting.

```{figure} assets/interp_export.png
:name: interp_export

The dialog for exporting shapes.
Always enable *Shape labels* and *Shape attributes*.
```

```{admonition} Interpolation versus reality: interpretation
:class: warning

As one may notice, lines between points in the polyline and polygon shapes are simply interpolated.
That means that to accurately interpret a given section, additional points (vertices) should be added along the entire feature to accurately depict one's interpretation.
One should therefore always treat the polyline and polygon "lines" as a visualisation aid, and definitely not as the interpretation itself (i.e., the interpretation are only the points within the shapes).
```
