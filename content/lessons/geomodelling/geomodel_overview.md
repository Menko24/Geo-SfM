# Geomodelling overview

## Interpretation of digital models.

Various software packages allow for digital models to be interpreted and annotated.
Blender, Lime, and MOVE come to mind, but there are many others.

These pages provide a cheatsheet on the annotation and interpretation of 3D model data in the following programs:

- [Agisoft Metashape](gemodel_tutorial.md)
- [ArcGIS Pro](arcgis_cheatsheet.md)
- [QGIS](qgis_cheatsheet.md)

```{admonition} Download sample data

The Svalbox DOM 2021-0056 (Konusdalen outcrop) package discussed by {cite:t}`betlemSvalboxDigitalModel2023` contains a .3tz that can be downloaded and used to follow along in the different tutorials.
Visit and {download}`https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7762909` the {kbd}`export` folder, then extract its contents.
The folder contains both a .3tz and .obj fileset, as well as the outcrop's footprint.
